                Unlike the other races of the Horde, orcs are not native to Azeroth. Initially, they lived as shamanic clans on the lush world of Draenor. They abandoned their peaceful culture when Kil’jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, corrupted the orcs and used them in his vengeful plot against the draenei, who were exiles from Kil’jaeden’s homeworld.

            <p>
                The dry, harsh land of Durotar is home to some of the toughest creatures on Azeroth. Unwary travelers may fall prey to venomous scorpids, ferocious crocolisks, or angry quilboar. Thrall chose to settle this inhospitable area after the Third War as penance for the orcs’ past transgressions. He named the land after his father, Durotan, former chieftain of the Frostwolf clan. Following the Cataclysm, many of the orcish settlements were flooded or destroyed, and the Northwatch soldiers at Tiragarde Keep have become more aggressive than ever. As relations worsen between the Alliance and the Horde, it is essential that the orcs contain these threats swiftly to ensure the survival of their people.

                Named for the former Horde warchief Orgrim Doomhammer, this capital was rapidly constructed when the orcs first settled in Durotar. Garrosh Hellscream has recently rebuilt most of the city’s architecture, and now Orgrimmar’s fortresses rank among the most imposing on Azeroth. Spiked metal towers line the city’s streets, and the red-and-black banners of the Horde wave from every post. Most of the various races have separated into their own districts, from the tauren in the Valley of Wisdom to the trolls in the Valley of Spirits. Grommash Hold towers over all else, allowing Garrosh Hellscream to keep a close watch on his people.

                    Long ago, the orcs tamed the large and swift wolves of Draenor. These massive canines came to be the orcs’ chosen companions as well as their favored method of transportation. The wolves’ unflinching temperament made them especially well-suited for battling large prey. When the orcs became more warlike and invaded Azeroth, their wolves were bred for size and stamina so they could bear armored riders into battle. Dire wolves remain the favored mounts for orc fighters and can be purchased in the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar.
