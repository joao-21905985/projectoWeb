                The savage trolls of Azeroth are infamous for their cruelty, dark mysticism, and seething hatred for all other races. Yet one exception among the trolls is the Darkspear tribe. Plagued by a history of subservience and exile, this proud tribe was on the brink of extinction when Warchief Thrall and his mighty Horde forces were driven to the trolls’ remote island home in the South Seas during a violent storm

                The Echo Isles are a small cluster of tropical landmasses located near the arid coast of Durotar. In addition to being the home of the Darkspear trolls, the archipelago teems with raptors, tigers, and other dangerous predators. Yet the hostile wildlife is the least of the tribe’s worries. Although the Darkspears have liberated the Echo Isles from Zalazane, a mysterious sea witch has recently appeared and begun using her dark sorcery to destroy the trolls’ way of life. Additionally, naga have overtaken territory just north of Darkspear Isle, the seat of power for the tribe. Having been exiles throughout their history, the Darkspears are prepared to make any sacrifice in order to protect their home. Even now, a new generation of fearless trolls is training on Darkspear Isle, ready to give its lives for the future of the tribe.

            <p>
                Ever since defeating the traitorous witch doctor Zalazane, the Darkspear tribe has worked tirelessly to fortify their home on Darkspear Isle. Covered in a network of huts and bridges, this jungle island has become a symbol of the tribe’s glory, albeit at a time when the trolls’ destiny remains uncertain due to the shocking loss of their leader, Vol'jin. Regardless, the Darkspear tribe has vowed to stand firm and face whatever challenges lie ahead.

                    The ferocity of Kalimdor’s raptors has enthralled the Darkspear trolls ever since their arrival on the Echo Isles years ago. The tribe considers a raptor to be the purest embodiment of the hunter’s essence, and as such, a tamed reptilian is prized as a mount. Skilled Darkspear riders have even been known to channel their raptors’ savagery to suit their will. Possession of these predators is also one of the most auspicious signs of status among trolls; many have died trying to subdue these swift and deadly raptors, and to control one indicates great station.
