                    When playing for the first time, subscribers choose their race and class. There are two primary factions in the game, the Alliance and the Horde. The races of the Alliance include: humans, gnomes, dwarves, night elves, and dranei. The races available
                    to the Horde are: orcs, forsaken (undead), tauren, trolls, and blood elves. Once players choose their faction and race, they choose their class (or role) in the game. The available classes are: druid, priest, mage, shaman, warlock,
                    warrior, paladin, and hunter. Players start at level one and gain experience (XP) for completing quests while exploring increasingly difficult and dangerous areas. They progress to a maximum level of 80. While doing so, players can
                    form groups of up to five members for some challenges while forming groups as large as 25 (raid) for more challenging situations. In addition to these, players can form player guilds with individuals to collectively plan and organize
                    events. World of Warcraft also has a thriving in-world econonmy. Completing quests also often includes a monetary reward in addition to the experience awarded. Players can also create and sell items they create in-world using an auction
                    house that functions in a similar way to eBay.</p>

                    The term faction is also used to refer specifically to the two playable factions in World of Warcraft: the Alliance and the Horde. Each playable race is specifically aligned with one faction or the other, and all player characters of that race automatically
                    belong to that faction.

                            The Horde is made up of orcs, forsaken, tauren, trolls, blood elves, and most recently, goblins. Misunderstood and cast aside, these diverse and powerful races strive to overcome their differences and unite as one in order to win freedom for their people
                            and prosper in a land that has come to hate them. In the Horde, action and strength are valued above diplomacy, and its leaders earn respect by the blade, wasting no time with politics.

                            are champions of justice, hope, knowledge, and faith. In a time when chaos and uncertainty reign, the Alliance remains steadfast in its determination to bring light to the darkest corners of the world.
